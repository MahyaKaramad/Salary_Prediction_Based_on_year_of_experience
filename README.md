# Salary Prediction Model

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning model that predicts salary based on years of experience using a linear regression algorithm. The project includes data pre-processing, visualization, model training, and an interactive salary prediction feature.

## Project Overview

This repository contains code to:
- Load and display a dataset of salaries and years of experience.
- Visualize the relationship between years of experience and salary using a scatter plot.
- Split the dataset into training and test sets for model evaluation.
- Train a linear regression model to predict salary.
- Interact with the user by predicting salary based on input for years of experience.

### Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualizing the data.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model selection and training.
